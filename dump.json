Much of the argument that the Soviet political system and economy needed reform needed change to avoid collapse came directly from him - the phrase \"Era of Stagnation\" to describe the Brezhnev years is actually a piece of Gorbachev's rhetoric.\r\n\r\nHowever there seems to be a strong case (made by Stephen Kotkin in Armageddon Averted), that while the Soviet economy was growing at ever slower rates, and increasingly unable to close the ever-present gap in living standards between the USSR and the West, probably could have continued to muddle on - there was no imminent danger of political and economic collapse in 1985.\r\n\r\nIt's also important to note that Gorbachev's reforms did not cause the collapse of the USSR on purpose, and Gorbachev was always committed to maintaining the union in some reformed shape under an economic system that was still socialist. However, his reforms both began to pick apart the centralized economy without really creating new institutions, which caused severe economic disruptions, and his political reforms unleashed new political movements outside his control, while all of these reforms antagonized more hardline members of the nomenklatura (party establishment). Ultimately he lost control of the situation.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet system was highly-centralized and governed in a top-down approach, and it was Gorbachev who put reforms into motion and also removed members of the Soviet government and Communist party who opposed reforms.\r\n\r\nGorbachev's period tends to get divided into roughly three periods: a period of reform, a period of transformation, and a period of collapse.\r\n\r\nThe period of reform lasted roughly from 1985 to 1988, in which Gorbachev and his supporters in the government (notably Eduard Shevardnadze, Gorbachev's foreign minister and the future President of Georgi, and Aleksandr Yakovlev, Gorbachev's ally on the Politburo and the intellectual driver of reforms) tried a mixture of moderate reforms and moral suasion to revitalize the Soviet economy as it was, echoing Khrushchev's reforms of 20 years previous. While the goal was a revitalization of Soviet society and the economy, there was a very strong focus on morality: this period notably featured the anti-alcoholism/prohibition campaign, and very public campaigns against corruption (Dmitry Furman called this a \"sort of Marxist Protestantism\").\r\n\r\nWhen these efforts did not secure the results that Gorbachev and his reformers desired, more far-reaching reforms were pursued in the 1988-1990 period. This is when Gorbachev made massive changes to Soviet foreign policy, such as withdrawing from Afghanistan in 1989, announcing unilateral cuts to military spending and forces at the UN in 1988, and more or less cutting the USSR's Eastern European satellite states in 1989. On the domestic sphere, this is when Gorbachev pushed through major political changes to the Soviet system, pushing through a new Congress of People's Deputies to be filled through semi-free elections, removing the Communist Party's monopoly of power and creating the office of President of the USSR for himself in 1990. This is also the period when glasnost (\"openness\", ie the lifting of censorship) took off, and these all were largely attempts to establish a new base of support for continued reforms once it became clear to Gorbachev that most of the Communist Party was uninterested in this.\r\n\r\nThese reforms ushered in the 1990-1991 chaos, at which point Gorbachev essentially lost control. Falling oil prices and the crackdown on alcohol sales (which were a massive part of the Soviet budget), plus Gorbachev's loosening of management and sales restrictions on state firms while maintaining most of their subsidies, plus plans for importing of new Western machine tools and technology to revitalize the economy, seriously destabilized the Soviet budget, and caused the government to turn to the printing presses to cover ever increasing deficits.", "category": "History:USSR"}}, {"model": "notes.note", "pk": 2, "fields": {"date_created": "2025-03-31", "title": "Collapse of USSR (Part 2)", "author": ["srabon"], "content": "In order to refocus and modernize industrial production, the Soviet Union needed to import new machine tools from abroad. An increase of importation of machine tools, coupled with a fall in international oil revenues (from 30.9 billion rubles in 1984 to 20.7 billion rubles in 1988) caused a massive increase in the deficit: from some 17-18 billion rubles in 1985 to 48-50 billion rubles in 1986, and rising. This was also coupled by a fall in domestic governmental revenue, as Gorbachev’s anti-alcohol campaign cut sales receipts (a Soviet version of a sales tax) from 103 billion rubles in 1983-1984 to 91.5 billion rubles in 1986. The deficit continued to climb, reaching an estimated 120 billion rubles in 1989 (or 10-12 percent of Soviet GNP). By 1990, no one really knew how large the deficit was in reality, and with increasing political reforms giving greater sovereignty to the Soviet Republics, some three fourths of tax collections were withheld from the center by the Republican governments, leading to an effective bankruptcy of the Soviet government. The Soviet government responded to these deficits by printing money, which in turn caused a sharp rise in inflation, an increased scarcity in goods, and a related decline in living standards. Glasnost (greater media openness) meant that increasingly the government was forced to admit the scale of the economic crisis, and the public was very well aware of the problem. As economist Marshall Goldman notes: ”Gorbachev’s well-intended but misguided economic strategy was in itself enough to cripple any chance to bring about the economic revitalization he wanted to badly. But the macroeconomic implications of his budget deficit eventually came to have their own impact. Whatever their commitment to socialist economic planning, Soviet officials by 1989 and certainly by 1990 belatedly came to understand that macroeconomics and budget deficits, particularly large ones, do matter. As Gorbachev himself admitted in an October 19, 1990, speech to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, “We lost control over the financial situation in the country. This was our most serious mistake in the years of perestroika…Achieving a balanced budget today is the number one task and the most important one.”\r\n\r\nThe rising inflation and breakdown of the centralized economy (republics were declaring \"sovereignty\" and their ownership of local resources, firms became more interested in hoarding or selling resources than providing them to state-mandated partners, local citizens began hoarding whatever consumer products they could find) created a very real decline in the economy and living standards starting in 1989 and only getting worse from there on out (this answer I wrote discusses the decrease in births, increase in deaths, fall in life expectancy and decline in the Russian population over the 1990s, and these trends were exacerbated by the economic decline and social chaos that started in the late 1980s). The increasing decentralization of the political system made it extremely unclear who was in control of what, and Gorbachev in this period came under increasing attacks from conservatives, wanting a halt to all further reforms, and radicals who wanted more reforms pushed ahead more quickly - Grigory Yavlinsky's \"500 Days\" program, a plan to implement a full market economy, and its repudiation by Nikolai Ryzhkov (the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers) in August 1990 is a good example of this. This period also saw the rise of Boris Yeltsin as a specifically Russian politician outside of the Communist Party, complete with his election to the newly-created Russian presidency in June of 1991. After the failed attempt of conservatives to stop reforms in the August 1991 coup, Yeltsin conducted what was essentially a counter coup (per Plokhy) that more or less seized real power from Gorbachev. Yeltsin himself did not necessarily want a dissolution of the USSR, but the inability to create any sort of workable union-level model with the other republic heads (especially those in Ukraine), meant that effective power went to the republican leaders after Gorbachev's resignation in December 1991.\r\n\r\nNow different historians covering this period will emphasize different things. Stephen Kotkin focuses a bit on the \"reformist generation\", ie the communist party elites including Gorbachev who came of age under Khrushchev's reforms, and who, like Gorbachev, were interested in reforming the Soviet model to save it. Others (Leon Aron is an example) emphasize the role of Yakovlev as the intellectual force arguing for glasnost and perestroika. But at the end of the day Gorbachev was in charge - he was the one who retired members of the old guard, and pushed reforms through. He eventually lost control of the situation, and his missteps in handling the forces (mostly elite, but popular too) that he unleashed paved the way for Soviet power and institutions to unravel by 1991. \r\n\r\n# Sources\r\n\r\n* Aron, Leon. \"The \"Mystery\" of the Soviet Collapse\".
